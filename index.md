## The 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability: Our Digital Time Bomb

**On 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, millions of sensitive embedded and industrial computer systems worldwide will suddenly start behaving in unpredictable ways, unless we take coordinated action now. And what's worse, with unsecured time protocols, attackers don't need to wait until 2038.**

This is not science fiction. It's a real technical vulnerability affecting systems we rely on daily—from hospital equipment to power grids, from banking systems to transportation networks. This vulnerability is embedded in the fundamental architecture of our digital infrastructure.

## Why Should You Care?

Without proper preparation, we will face widespread disruptions including:

- Hospital equipment displaying incorrect medication times
- Banking systems failing to process payments
- Traffic control systems malfunctioning
- Power grid instabilities causing outages
- Internet service disruptions
- Security systems generating false alarms

In our interconnected world, these technical failures could have cascading effects. Critical system failures can endanger lives, disrupt economies, and compromise essential services. **And what's worse, malicious threat actors can manipulate time synchronization protocols in many cases to trigger this vulnerability at the time of their choosing.** This is particularly concerning given how little attention many networks pay to their Network Time Protocol (NTP) security.

## Understanding the 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability

Many computer systems track time using a 32-bit signed integer that counts seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z (known as "Unix time"). This approach has a mathematical limitation: when this counter reaches its maximum value on 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, affected systems will roll over to negative numbers, causing them to interpret the date as 1901-12-13T20:45:52Z.

This vulnerability exists in:

- Legacy systems running critical infrastructure
- Embedded devices in industrial settings
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices
- Transportation and energy management systems
- Medical equipment
- Financial transaction processors
- Telecommunications infrastructure
- Millions of "smart" devices in homes and businesses worldwide

## The Scale Is Unprecedented

The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability is definitively more severe than Y2K for several critical reasons:

1. **Massive Scale**: There are now hundreds of times more vulnerable systems than existed during Y2K. For the last 30 years, simple controller computers have been embedded into virtually everything that moves or connects.

2. **Embedded Nature**: Unlike Y2K, which primarily affected visible software that could be patched, today's vulnerability exists in countless embedded systems that cannot be easily updated. Many are physically inaccessible, buried in infrastructure or sealed in hardware.

3. **Increased Dependence**: Our society's dependence on digital infrastructure has increased dramatically since 2000. Critical systems from healthcare to transportation now rely entirely on accurate timestamps for basic operations.

4. **Security Implications**: The near-universal connectivity of today's systems means time-related vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. Unsecured time protocols mean attackers could potentially trigger failures at will.

5. **Less Visibility**: Many vulnerable systems operate without user interfaces or monitoring capabilities, making detection of problems significantly harder than with Y2K.

## A Global Challenge

Our digital infrastructure resembles an interconnected ecosystem. When individual components fail simultaneously, the entire system becomes vulnerable. Even if only 15-30% of critical systems fail, we will experience significant disruptions across multiple sectors.

The challenge is compounded by what economists call a "tragedy of the commons"—where responsibility is distributed but no single entity feels accountable for solving the shared problem. Organizations often assume:

- "Our systems represent only a small fraction of the infrastructure"
- "Other stakeholders will address the critical components"
- "Updating legacy systems offers minimal return on investment"

One of the most concerning aspects involves security infrastructure. When system clocks suddenly jump backward, security certificates will become invalid across large portions of the internet, compromising our digital security framework.

## Time is Limited, Action is Required

**With approximately 12 years remaining until the critical date, we must prioritize our response.**

Our analysis indicates we cannot replace or update all vulnerable systems in time. Many embedded devices cannot be updated at all. However, through coordinated action, we can:

1. Identify and prioritize the most critical vulnerable systems
2. Implement fixes where possible
3. Develop contingency plans for systems that cannot be updated
4. Establish global coordination to manage the transition

## Who We Are

The Epochalypse Project was founded by Trey Darley (aka "treyka") and Pedro Umbelino (aka "kripthor"), two cybersecurity researchers with extensive experience in vulnerability research and critical infrastructure protection.

Trey Darley has been working in IT since his teens, building a diverse career as a developer, sysadmin, network engineer, and cybersecurity specialist. His professional journey has included running IT for a major film production, foundational work in cyber threat intelligence, and serving in a load-bearing capacity at a national CERT during the COVID years. Trey also served on the FIRST.org board of directors, which took him around the world connecting with cybersecurity professionals.

Trey first became aware of the 2038 problem shortly after Y2K was addressed. Around 2016, he began jokingly referencing it in technical conference talks, saying "surely we're going to fix all these security vulnerabilities before 2038 rolls around." In 2023, he realized with alarm that 2038 is now closer to us than the 2008 financial crisis. While traveling globally in his FIRST.org role, Trey repeatedly asked knowledgeable contacts what was being done about the 2038 issue. He had assumed some government-sponsored technical group was addressing it, but discovered that no such master plan seems to exist.

Pedro Umbelino began his journey into technology at age 8, teaching himself to code BASIC on a Spectrum computer. By 14, he was decompiling computer viruses using A86/D86, sparked by a chance encounter with an Assembly language book at his local bookstore. Pedro's career has spanned roles as a sysadmin, developer, and entrepreneur, but computer security remained his passion throughout. For the past decade, he's focused exclusively on security research across various domains, discovering vulnerabilities in multiple systems along the way.

The Epochalypse Project began in 2024 after Pedro attended Trey's lightning talk at the hack.lu conference. Pedro had just presented "Blowing up Gas Stations for Fun and Profit," emphasizing the dangers of exposed industrial systems, when Trey's message about the looming 2038 problem struck him. Realizing that 2038 was closer than Y2K had been when preparations began, Pedro ran tests on a device and discovered fundamental vulnerabilities. He immediately reached out to Trey, and they decided to start this project together.

This initiative is a side effort driven by their shared concern about a critical vulnerability that isn't receiving adequate attention. As Trey puts it, "As it seems nobody has a master game plan, it's up to us to organize and take some coordinated action." Together, they bring complementary skills in technical research, vulnerability assessment, and public awareness campaigns—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.

The Epochalypse Project builds on their combined experience in coordinating responses to widespread vulnerabilities—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.

## The Epochalypse Project Mission

We are building a collaborative global initiative to address the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability through:

- Standardized testing methodologies
- Documentation of system vulnerabilities
- Development of remediation strategies
- Knowledge sharing across sectors and borders

Your participation matters—whether you're a technical expert or simply someone with a smartphone. Every test you run helps us map vulnerabilities, and every solution you share can safeguard countless systems.

## Why This Requires Urgent Global Attention

The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability has received insufficient attention despite being demonstrably more severe than Y2K. The technology industry has been aware of this issue since the 1990s, yet coordinated remediation efforts remain limited. **People aren't taking action right now, and this must change immediately.** The delay in addressing this vulnerability is not just concerning—it's potentially catastrophic.

**You can be part of the solution.**

The following sections outline how people in different roles can contribute to this critical effort.
