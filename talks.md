# Talks & Presentations

This page collects conference talks and public presentations that help
explain 2038-class rollover risks, time infrastructure fragility, and
the wider Epochalypse problem space.

Where possible we link to recordings and slides so others can reuse the material.

## Featured Talk

### 2038 Is Not A Future Issue: Get That Through Your Thick Skull

- **Speakers:** Trey Darley & Pedro Umbelino
- **Event:** BSides Lisbon
- **Date:** November 2025 
- **Focus:** Why 2038-class issues are already observable today, how time
  infrastructure creates systemic risk, and why “we’ll fix it later” is not a
  viable strategy.

## Other Relevant Talks

> **Note:** This is a living list. We’ll keep adding new talks as they’re recorded
> or become public.

### Pedro Umbelino — Blowing Up Gas Stations for Fun and Profit

- **Speaker:** Pedro Umbelino  
- **Event:** hack.lu  
- **Focus:** Exposed industrial control systems, fuel controllers, and how
  fragile real-world embedded infrastructure can be when it’s put on the
  internet without guardrails.  
- **Relevance to 2038:** Shows how embedded field equipment with long life
  cycles and weak update paths becomes a security problem — the same pattern
  we’re worried about for timestamp rollover.

### Trey Darley — Lightning Talk on 2038 (hack.lu)

- **Speaker:** Trey Darley  
- **Event:** hack.lu (lightning talk)  
- **Focus:** Early public framing of the 2038 problem as a coordination and
  incentives failure, not a “hard math” problem.
